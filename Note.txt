The goal of this website is not only to share information about my own running club, but also to connect all Chinese runners around the Chicago Marathon. We aim to foster collaboration among different running groups, promote group runs, and encourage visits between teams. When I travel to a new place, I hope to find local running groups to run with—sharing the same culture, language, and passion for running.
